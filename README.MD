# DATA-CENTRIC DEVELOPMENT


## My third Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using the technologies that I have learnt so far from Code Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, JavaScript, Python, Flask and NoSQL(MongoDB).

The site designed was a recipe cookery web based application. Database was stored and retrieved from the backend(MongoDB).
I have decided to follow the project requirement provided in brief.

## UX

The UX for this project is easy and understandable. It is mainly a web based application that also function well on mobie. 
Navigations are quite easy and smooth for users. The application is intuitive to use and has information on it presented well.
There is a filter that allows user to narrow/navigate thier search through the application. 
The web application allows user to create,read(view),edit(update) and delete smoothly.

The data schema used displays perfectly throughout the form thus allowing user to implement the CRUD rule perfectly. 
The application allows for addition of a new image or automatically adds a default image. 
The colour scheme was very simple and makes the site quite clear and readable enough for users.
This application is very easy for a user to manipulate and understand.


## Features 

* Navbar - Materialize was used for quick production of modern CSS and use of their predefinded classes.

* Images - Flask werkzeug was used to allow user attach image files. Images used are acquired via google.

* Card - Materialize predefinded classes was used for great UX view. 

* Button/Links - Was used to allow/trigger users intentions/actions on application.

* Material Icon -  Icons was used to improve the UX for each logo when viewed by a user/visitor.

* Forms/Filter - Materialize and Flask WTForms was helpful with predefined classes usable in Jinja templates.

* Wireframing- I just did some mock ups on paper with pen of how the site generally should look and feel. 


### Possible feature to implement 

* User Account - Try to add ability for a user to Sign Up/Sign In


### Getting Started

The website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript and JQuery** for interactivity, **Python**, **Materialize** frameworks, **Flask** frameworks

### Prerequisites

The site is fully functional without any local files needed to be downloaded all frameworks and scripts
used are loaded via an approved CDN. Before deployment the site was tested on several browsers and devices.
This site is supported on all browsers. Check below for tested devices and browsers.

## Deployment

### GitHub Deployment

Created a new repositories on **Github** where the project will be deployed unto at each commit.
At first, use a **git remote** command to link project with new repo.
Then use the **git push -u origin master** command to push codes and every change into new repo

Using the CLI in terminal to call **git init** to start git initialization on the project.
This allows a file/files to be added to the Github repo by calling a **git add** command.
Then any added file/files is being commited with a **git commit -m "commit message"** command.
Afterwards, the file is been pushed with **git push** where Github username + password is required.
Once successful, code will be deployed into your repo and **git status** command should indicate branch tree clean.


### Heroku Deployment

Created a new app on **Heroku** where the app is hosted live.
At first, to allow **Heroku** locate application we login into the CLI using ** heroku login -i** command.
You will be requested to imput username and password for **Heroku** account. 
After which you can request **Heroku Apps** via CLI. 

Knowing the apps you need to pass deployment into then we can use **heroku git:remote -a <app>** 
to allow Git automatically update deployment in Heroku. 
Once this has been remotely passed . 
To host the app unto heroku pass the IP and PORT config to match the route **__main__** config.

To allow git to push to heroku the command **git push heroku master** must be called for a final **push**.
For a succefull and healthy push it is best adviced to have the **requirement.txt** and **Procfile** 
files installed or updated. Most especially for **requirement.txt** file which gave me a lot of challenges,
it requires to be updated along with any installed packages so it can depoly successfully, i.e Flask packages.



### HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, Python

All my mark up is **HTML valid**
All my styling is **CSS valid**
All my syntax is **JavaScript syntactically valid**
All my routing is **Python valid**

#### Version Used

I use [GitHub](github.com) for version control. Which backup my code incase I encounter a bug or an error that needs urgent fix. 
I can easily traceback my code on GitHub.
