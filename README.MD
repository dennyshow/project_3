# DATA-CENTRIC DEVELOPMENT

## My third Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using the technologies that I have learnt so far from Code Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, JavaScript, Python, Flask and NoSQL(MongoDB).

The site designed was a recipe cookery web based application. 
Database was stored and retrieved via MongoDB
I have decided to follow the project requirement provided in brief.

## UX

The UX for this project is easy and understandable. It is mainly a web based application that also function well on mobie. 
Navigations are quite easy and smooth for users. The application is intuitive to use and has information on it presented well.
There is a filter that allows user to narrow/navigate thier search through the application. 
The data schema used displays perfectly on the form thus allowing user to implement the CRUD rule. 

The application allows for addition of a new image or automatically adds a default image. 
The colour scheme was very simple and makes the site quite clear and readable enough for users.
This application is very easy for a user to manipulate and understand.


## Features 

* Images for this project have been acquired via google.

* Navbar - Materialize used for quick production of modern CSS and use of their predefinded classes.

* Button - Was used to allow/trigger users actions on application.

* Materialize Icon -  Icons was used to improve the UX for the logo when viewed by a user/visitor.

* Wireframing- I just did some mock ups on paper with pen of how the site generally should look and feel. 


### Possible feature to implement 

* Animate - Try to add some anime interactions in charts


### Getting Started

The website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript and JQuery** for interactivity, **Python**, **Materialize** framework, **Flask** framework

## Deployment 

Created a new repositories on **Github** where the project will be deployed unto at each commit.
At first, use a **git remote** command to link project with new repo.
Then use the **git push -u origin master** command to push codes and every change into new repo

Using the CLI in terminal to call **git init** to start git initialization on the project.
This allows a file/files to be added to the Github repo by calling a **git add** command.
Then any added file/files is being commited with a **git commit -m "commit message"** command.
Afterwards, the file is been pushed with **git push** where Github username + password is required.
Once successful, code will be deployed into your repo and **git status** command should indicate branch tree clean.
