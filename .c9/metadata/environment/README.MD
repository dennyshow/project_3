Database was stored and retrieved from the backend(MongoDB).\nI have decided to follow the project requirement provided in brief.\n\n## UX\n\nThe UX for this project is easy and understandable. It is mainly a web based application that also function well on mobie. \nNavigations are quite easy and smooth for users. The application is intuitive to use and has information on it presented well.\nThere is a filter that allows user to narrow/navigate thier search through the application. \nThe web application allows user to create,read(view),edit(update) and delete smoothly.\n\nThe data schema used displays perfectly throughout the form thus allowing user to implement the CRUD rule perfectly. \nThe application allows for addition of a new image or automatically adds a default image. \nThe colour scheme was very simple and makes the site quite clear and readable enough for users.\nThis application is very easy for a user to manipulate and understand.\n\n\n## Features \n\n* Navbar - Materialize was used for quick production of modern CSS and use of their predefinded classes.\n\n* Images - Flask werkzeug was used to allow user attach image files. Images used are acquired via google.\n\n* Card - Materialize predefinded classes was used for great UX view. \n\n* Button/Links - Was used to allow/trigger users intentions/actions on application.\n\n* Material Icon -  Icons was used to improve the UX for each logo when viewed by a user/visitor.\n\n* Forms/Filter - Materialize and Flask WTForms was helpful with predefined classes usable in Jinja templates.\n\n* Wireframing- I just did some mock ups on paper with pen of how the site generally should look and feel. \n\n\n### Possible feature to implement \n\n* User Account - Try to add ability for a user to Sign Up/Sign In\n\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThe website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript and JQuery** for interactivity, **Python**, **Materialize** frameworks, **Flask** frameworks\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe site is fully functional without any local files needed to be downloaded all frameworks and scripts\nused are loaded via an approved CDN. Before deployment the site was tested on several browsers and devices.\nThis site is supported on all browsers. Check below for tested devices and browsers.\n\n# [Live Demo Here](https://diy-cookery.herokuapp.com/)\n\n### External sites used \n\n* [Materialize 0.100.2](https://materializecss.com/) - The web framework used \n* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - Help & tips \n* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Help & tips\n* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) -Help & tips\n* [Material Icon](https://material.io/) - Icons \n* [Favicons](https://favicon.io/) - Icons\n* [Colors](https://coolors.co/) - Colours\n* [Materialize JS](http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/getting-started.html) - Materialize JS\n\n### Frameworks used \n\n* [Materialize 0.100.2](https://materializecss.com/)\n* [Material Icon](https://material.io/)\n* [JQuery 3.2.1](https://jquery.com/download/)\n* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)\n\n\n## Custom Fonts \n\nI used fonts from **@googleapis CSS 'Overlock, Londrina+Solid'** to create difference in headers and written styles.\n\n## Technologies used\n\n\n* JQuery & JavaScript - Was used to allow interactivity, file attachment and buttons to function smoothly. [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)\n\n* NoSQL - MongoDB was used to create database and pulled via the route. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)\n\n* Python - Was used to route and call backend database schema from MongoDB.[Python](Lecture Notes)\n\n* Flask - Produces very useful packages like Jinja,WTForms,PyMongo that allows application to be more functional.[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)\n\n* Heroku - Was used to deploy application to run on any every technological devices. [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)\n\n* Materialze JS - For easy dropdown during user select option and mobile screen view [Materialize](http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/getting-started.html)\n\n* Favicons - Used to improve UX when viewing the top of the webpage. [Favicon-generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)\n\n* Materialize Classes - To trigger more styles and reduce CSS over-styling [Materialize](http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/)\n\n* Material Icon - To improve view of UX when surfing the application [Material Icon](https://material.io/)\n\n\n\n## Testing\n\n+ Tested on **Chrome** (Tested in DevOps on all mobile and tablet devices

Deployment\n\nCreated a new repositories on **Github** where the project will be deployed unto at each commit.\nAt first, use a **git remote** command to link project with new repo.\nThen use the **git push -u origin master** command to push codes and every change into new repo\n\nUsing the CLI in terminal to call **git init** to start git initialization on the project.\nThis allows a file/files to be added to the Github repo by calling a **git add** command.\nThen any added file/files is being commited with a **git commit -m \"commit message\"** command.\nAfterwards, the file is been pushed with **git push** where Github username + password is required.\nOnce successful, code will be deployed into your repo and **git status** command should indicate branch tree clean.\n\n\n### Heroku Deployment\n\nCreated a new app on **Heroku** where the app is hosted live.\nAt first, to allow **Heroku** locate application we login into the CLI using ** heroku login -i** command.\nYou will be requested to imput username and password for **Heroku** account. \nAfter which you can request **Heroku Apps** via CLI. \n\nKnowing the apps you need to pass deployment into then we can use **heroku git:remote -a <app>** \nto allow Git automatically update deployment in Heroku. \nOnce this has been remotely passed . \nTo host the app unto heroku pass the IP and PORT config to match the route **__main__** config.\n\nTo allow git to push to heroku the command **git push heroku master** must be called for a final **push**.\nFor a succefull and healthy push it is best adviced to have the **requirement.txt** and **Procfile** \nfiles installed or updated. Most especially for **requirement.txt** file which gave me a lot of challenges,\nit requires to be updated along with any installed packages so it can depoly successfully, i.e Flask packages.\n\n\n\n### HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, Python\n\nAll my mark up is **HTML valid**\nAll my styling is **CSS valid**\nAll my syntax is **JavaScript syntactically valid**\nAll my routing is **Python valid**\n\n#### Version Used\n\nI use [GitHub](github.com) for version control. Which backup my code incase I encounter a bug or an error that needs urgent fix. \nI can easily traceback my code on GitHub.\n\n\n### Authors\n\n**Dehinde - Shogbanmu** - *Project 3* \n\n\n\n## Credits\n\n### Content \nThe images used was retrieved from Google\nThe recipe used was retreived from Google\nThe logos was generated via icon8\nThe data was retrived from my MongoDB database\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nI received a great inspiration for this project via my mentor, he was a great help.\nAli
